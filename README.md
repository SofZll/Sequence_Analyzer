## Description

Web App that given a FASTA file is able to:
- parse the FASTA file and generates the trancription of a DNA sequence,
- show stats and frequency of nitrogenous bases,
- generates the DNA translations and show the obtained tRNA,
- allows amino acid chaining, and protein identification

## Input
The input consists of the complete genome sequence previously saved in the directory *"./fasta_file"*.
The alowed FASTA file extension are: *.fasta*, *.fna*, and *.fa*.


## to Run the Code
```bash
python3 Sequence_Analyzer.py
```
